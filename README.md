# rh_sat_reg_and_ak_list
This script will print directions and a list of available Activation Keys and place it in /var/www/html/pub directory. This directory is normally publicly accessible and no authentication is necessary or required. When it is in place other admins will have simple directions and be able to view the AKs that are available on the Satellite Server from http://<sat_server>/pub/activation-key.txt
